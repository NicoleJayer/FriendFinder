# FriendFinder

**Intro**

Friend finder is an application that utilizes the users response to ten question to match them with the characters of your choosing, based on the chosen theme of the project. The idea is to have a response option 1-5, with one being strongly disagree, and 5 being strongly agree, using the total of these ten numbers to calculate a best match from a pre-set of scores in the *friends.js* file.

The application uses node.js and express for the back end work, and jquery, javascript, and the materialize CSS library for the front end.

**About Friend Finder**

I chose a Gilmore girls theme for this project because I wanted to highlight a show that is near and dear to my heart. I find that when I am passionate about the subject matter, it makes the whole process a lot of fun. This was definitely the most challenging assignment we have had to tackle to-date, but I think with the help of classmates, and references of previous projects, I was able to put together a nice finished product.

**Application DEMO**

Part of the assignment requirements was to deploy the application to Heroku. You can check out the program here: https://frozen-gorge-85082.herokuapp.com/
